## **Pinniped Project Roadmap**


### 
**About this document**

This document provides a link to the[ Pinniped Project issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/issues) list that serves as the up to date description of items that are in the Pinniped release pipeline. Most items are gathered from the community or include a feedback loop with the community. This should serve as a reference point for Pinniped users and contributors to understand where the project is heading, and help determine if a contribution could be conflicting with a longer term plan.


### 
**How to help?**

Discussion on the roadmap can take place in threads under [Issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/issues) or in [community meetings](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#meeting-with-the-maintainers). Please open and comment on an issue if you want to provide suggestions and feedback to an item in the roadmap. Please review the roadmap to avoid potential duplicated effort.


### 
**Need an idea for a contribution?**

We’ve created an [Opportunity Areas](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/discussions/483) discussion thread that outlines some areas we believe are excellent starting points for the community to get involved. In that discussion we’ve included specific work items that one might consider that also support the high-level items presented in our roadmap. 


### 
**How to add an item to the roadmap?**

Please open an issue to track any initiative on the roadmap of Pinniped (usually driven by new feature requests). We will work with and rely on our community to focus our efforts to improve Pinniped.


### 
**Current Roadmap**

The following table includes the current roadmap for Pinniped. If you have any questions or would like to contribute to Pinniped, please attend a [community meeting](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#meeting-with-the-maintainers) to discuss with our team. If you don't know where to start, we are always looking for contributors that will help us reduce technical, automation, and documentation debt. Please take the timelines & dates as proposals and goals. Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback, roadblocks encountered, community contributions, etc. If you depend on a specific item, we encourage you to attend community meetings to get updated status information, or help us deliver that feature by contributing to Pinniped.
